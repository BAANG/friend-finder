# Friend Finder

Friend Finder is a web-based application that allows the user to be matched with another according to their compatibility scores defined by the answers they choose in the survey questions *(albeit, not very accurately or by any real metrics since I made up the questions myself).*

This application was an assignment I completed for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp as my first attempt at engineering and deploying my first full-stack site. And as such, I utilized both front-end and back-end languages/technologies.
